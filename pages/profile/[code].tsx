// This code displays a public profile page for NFC pins, allowing users to view their profile information,
// download a vCard, copy the profile link, and edit their profile if they are the owner. It uses QR codes for easy sharing and updates the profile's viewed timestamp in Firestore when accessed.
// It also handles cases where the profile is unclaimed by redirecting to the edit page.
